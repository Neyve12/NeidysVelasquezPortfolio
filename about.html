    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Neidys Velasquez. I’m a Java Software Developer passionate about building user-centric applications that solve real problems.
      I have a solid foundation in full-stack development, with skills in Java, relational databases, Spring Boot, and Test-Driven Development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background in insurance taught me the value of empathy and clear communication with clients, which I now use to create thoughtful, accessible software solutions.
      I’m particularly drawn to roles where I can contribute to a product's vision while collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive quality and performance.
      I'm eager to bring my technical and interpersonal skills to a team that values innovation and impact.
    </p>
